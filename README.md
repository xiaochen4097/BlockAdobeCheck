Sync Host List from adoveisadumb

IP and domain list is from https://github.com/ignaciocastro/a-dove-is-dumb
Thank to their work, I wrote this repo to sync the list to your own host file without installing other host manage tools.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo
2. Run  pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run py main.py as admin
